# Assignment 1

## Due date

This Thursday, by the time you get to lab.

## The assigment:

0. Send your TA your GitHub user name.  Do this IMMEDIATELY
1. Clone this repo
2. Answer the questions in "questions.md" in a NEW BRANCH.  When showing code, your answers should be correctly
   formatted using Markdown!
3. Submit a pull request based on your changes
4. Request a code review from your TA

## Expectations

You will probably have to do Google searches, etc., to figure out some of the answers.  That's part of the job when
doing computational work--you have to figure things out.
